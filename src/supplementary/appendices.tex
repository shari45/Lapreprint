Problems worthy \\
of attack \\
prove their worth \\
by hitting back. \\
\\
Put up in a place \\
where it's easy to see \\
the cryptic admonishment\\
    T.T.T. \\
\\
When you feel how depressingly \\
slowly you climb, \\
it's well to remember that\\
Things Take Time. \\
\\
The road to wisdom? - Well, it's plain\\
and simple to express: \\
   Err \\
   and err \\
   and err again \\ 
   but less \\
   and less \\
   and less. \\
